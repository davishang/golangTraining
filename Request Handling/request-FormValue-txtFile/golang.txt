https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)

Go (often referred to as golang) is an open source programming language developed at Google[10] in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.[8] Designed primarily for systems programming, it is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added.[11]

The language was announced in November 2009; it is used in some of Google's production systems,[12] as well as by other firms. Two major implementations exist: Google's Go compiler, "gc", is developed as open source software and targets various platforms including Linux, OS X, Windows, various BSD and Unix versions, and since 2015 also mobile devices, including smartphones.[13] A second compiler, gccgo, is a GCC frontend.[14][15] The "gc" toolchain is self-hosting since version 1.5.[16]
